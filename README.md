-) Why have you chosen this pathway?

Because, I wanted to expand on the Adventure Game, that I have created in the previous assignment.


-) What have been the difficulties during development?

Feature Creep. Also wanting to add new Features, can be very overwhelming.

## How To Play
80s Text Adventures inspired this game, which used the keyboard to interact with the Game World. So, this game also mainly uses the keyboard for user interactions.
To interact with the Game World, one types the letter inside the Brackets [ ], and presses enter.
