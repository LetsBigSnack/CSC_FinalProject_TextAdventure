# Final Project
## Introduction
This is your final assignment and project for the course Client Side Coding and you have the open choice between the following pathways that will be explained in detail below. 
All of them are equally graded and you should have an approximate workload of **35h - 40h**. The pathways are there in order to give those who need it a direction and those who want to be completely free the opportunity to do so :).

## 3. Extend Text Adventure

For this task you take your basic text adventure you did in the first exercise and completly rework it. 
Use one of the learned methods to make it more "dynamic". E.g. a JSON file for all the scenarios or an object structure. 
It should completely rely on the DOM and the interactions of the user with it. NO alert, prompt or confirm are allowed. 
Add some kind of persistance to it. E.g. add a score board, a history, or save point if you will so. 
You should just use the concept of local storage.

### ðŸ”¥ Required:

* [ ] Improve the general style and appearance of the game. Add images etc. Work on the interface and enhance it with a introdcution and so on.
* [ ] Use local storage at least once.
* [ ] Add far more logic and pathways to your game it should be a real story.
* [ ] Add more game aspects, e.g. inventory, health, attacks, etc. which improve the logic and flow of the game.
* [ ] Use sounds and music and integrate it. It can be toggled on and off. You don't have to have it all the time.

### ðŸ’¡NO Optional
