## Notes
- Player.js -> default_stats can also be a copied array of stats which is done in the constructor [X]
    - Needs to be done in every Constructor otherwise it will not work and only the default_stats of Player will be taken as the value.
- Maybe create a new UtilityClass with dialog options ? (like confirmDialogs) ?
- Confirm dialog in CharacterCreation.js can be restructured in a method [ ]
- Don't have enough motivation to complete everything --> unfinished task will be sent to 01-01-2023
- Split text inside Switch Statement into different Functions ?
