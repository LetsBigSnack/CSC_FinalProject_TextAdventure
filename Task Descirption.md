## Project: Text based adventure
Your task is to create a text based adventure game like we did in the course. Take it as inspiration and tell your own adventure. 
Improve and enhance it and use visual or sound if you want!!



## Description:

The following things are required:

* The game contains at least 5 pathways (choicies, e.g. confirm or prompt) dialogs
* Use confirm, prompt, and alert dialogs (except you are doing the advanced version)
* Two of your choices need to be at least multiple ones. This means give the user options (min. 3 Options)
* You need to check all options and provide feedback based on which option is choosen.
* The game needs to be started with a dedicated "Start" button (not necessarily has to be the name "Start")


## Submission:

You need to submit all the files that are required to execute the program. Do this please in a .zip format.



## Rating:

The following things will be considered during your work evaluation (detailed breakdown later on):

Are all requirements met?
Does it work? Does it run?
Is the work different from the one in the course?
Can you explain it (in course and documentation)


## ⚠️Advanced⚠️

* Use custom dialogs or user input from the DOM instead of built in dialogs
* Break it down in to seperate logic so you can restart various pathways
* Add images, sound, etc. to the screen for each pathway
*All the advanced things will be done together in the next course after together anyway and this is just for those people who want to do the advanced things.
